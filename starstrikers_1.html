		<h1>Diary 1 - Forming a New Team</h1>
		<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>"YOU ARE FIRED!!"</strong></span> said the general towards the purple military mole with some green camouflage clothes, called Sactep, after failing his general for the last time. "But sire," Sactep begged, "How should I know if the enemy is in there? They did ambush &amp; destroy me." "I did mark it on your mission map. Did you not notice the red marker on there, The red marker marks the enemy's location." General said. "Oh, I thought it said enemy's crate, not the enemy itself." Sactep admitted, "You wouldn't forgive me for the action, hahaha." and just before Sactep laughs it off, General kicked him out of the camp.</p>
		<p>"Grrr. Maybe. Just maybe. If I've paid more attention to the details," Sactep walks away in anger. "Sigh. At least they still let me keep the weapons back." He checked the crate the general gave him, It contained Bazooka and several Grenades. "At least that'll help me on my next journey. but... I just need some crew members." Just as he thought, he sparked an idea. "I got it, Maybe I should form a team and build the base in safe place. Heh heh, just wait, Nadiya. <strong>Just... you... wait!</strong>"</p>
		<p>4 hours later, after the mission, He brought a lot of supplies &amp; weapons from the crates in his recently built base. Sactep was writing a little diary every mission, but he's sort of disappointed about lack of members. Angered, He heads out from the base for another mission in hopes of searching for another.</p>
		<p><strong>"Help!!"</strong> There's a sound coming from the direction to where the yacht is, He thought it's an opportunity to get to rescue one and make them a new member, so there he goes. He spotted the shaking one out of ten supplies boxes, but those are heavily guarded by the enemy worms. He was assumed to be stuffed in the box by accident while they weren't noticed, but eh, whatever... Sactep is thinking carefully on how to defeat them while not killing the kidnapped individual... "Think... Sactep... Think...!" Sactep said this before he threw a skunk towards the enemies. "What the!?" One of the enemy worm exclaimed; they ran off to get some fresh air, and the skunk followed one of them too.</p>

		<p>Inside the crate, Sactep found the spherical white and upper green-colored robot with two of retractable wheels that function as arms and another set of wheels that function as legs, a little green and watermelon pink antenna, He has a cute face with watermelon pink blushes and a watermelon pink "Y" on his forehead. "Thanks for saving me... I thought I was trapped here forever," the robot wheezed, and just before he introduced himself, Sactep asked, "Excuse me but I'm looking for new members of my team. Can you join me?" "Well, I have nothing to do anyway but also pay you back, So sure. Call me Yers, by the way," he insisted before getting off the crate. "Sactep's my name." "Sniff, What's the awful smell." Yers interrupted Sactep and asked bitterly. "My apologies; I had to shoo off those pesky guards by letting Skunk on their way." "It's okay. Let's get out of here before I faint." They ran off from the enemy's base.</p>
		<p>Back to Sactep's Base, Yers wheezed and was also relieved at same time, He's still worried about the environments of the world. "Umm..." Yers worried, saying, "How's the current condition of the world?" "Not pretty good, I must say. There are multiple battles going on throughout the wars and never stop. and I recently got dismissed from the army base for failing the mission. Awful day, eh?" "Uh-huh... Getting caught by enemies isn't fun. I was almost used for the new weapons... New weapons!? That's it!" "What is?" "That inspired me to start working on unique weapons! I'll lend you some help so you can use my newly made weapons." "Wowzers! That's a surprise from you. I appreciated your assistance, Welcome to my base!" Sactep and Yers went from worrying to inspiring talk. That's a pretty good day for their team.</p>
		<h1>Diary 2 - New Stranger</h1>
		<p>"Excuse me, I'm just stopping by to greet you all. My name is Bearmeri, the greatest actor in the world." He introduced himself in front of Sactep's base entrance. Bearmeri is a blue-eyed, orange-furred little bear with a big red nose and flaming hair on his forehead and back of the head. He also has some golden fluffs on his shoulder, as well as a lighter "@" symbol on his tummy and red claws on his hand.</p>
		<p><img src="./Assets/bearmeri.png" alt="Origins/Based off/Species: Bebear from Monster Squad" /></p>
		<p>"Oh, I'm Sactep, Thanks for the warm welcome." Sactep bows in greeting, then he notices the knife behind the greeter's back, to which he points out, "Say, What's that on your back? You aren't going to do the backstabbing, right?" "Oh? This knife?" Bearmeri laughed it off and said, "It's nothing to do with you. It's just... what the thieves do."</p>
		<p>"You're a thief? With the mask you're holding, you're most like a therapist." "That's Thespian to you." Bearmeri corrected Sactep. "which means I'm a rising actor in the showtime." "I never knew that! Did you get paid for the gig?" "Of course not," Bearmeri shook his head, "at least not yet..." with a sigh. "I'm still waiting for my big break. But I believe it's just a matter of time before I start getting paid for my performances." Bearmeri explained it optimistically.</p>
		<p>"Okay, then," Sactep said in confusion. "So, what're you doing here and have a business with my squad?" "Lately, I heard your crew has been advertised by some sort of mysterious worm." Bearmeri said. "I was wondering if you are able to accept my request." "Don't worry, I'll be happy to help you. What's up?" Sactep interrupted. "There were two worms sabotaging the theater I was going to attend and perform." Bearmeri said. "It's awful! I don't want to miss out on my gig. Not even friends of mine can attend either. We're going to be penalized for missing the gig."</p>
